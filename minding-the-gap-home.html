        <p class="chaptertext">George Washington Carver called education “the key to unlock the golden door of freedom.” The data backs that up: People with bachelor’s degrees or higher make nearly twice as much money as people whose educational journeys end after high school.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">But not every student has the same educational experience. Schools can be significantly different just a few miles apart, and that can be the difference between students achieving happy and successful lives or becoming part of the “school-to-prison pipeline.”</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">We explored the differences in Maryland's two most populous counties – Prince George's, which has the most underfunded school system in the state according to <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/448544094/ACY-MD-County-Brochure" target="_new">data from Advocates for Children and Youth</a>, and Montgomery, which is better funded but still faces its share of issues – to answer some big questions.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">How do Maryland’s educational approaches, especially disciplinary policies, differ by county? And how can those disparities—examined through the lenses of race, income and wealth—affect Maryland students not just when they’re in high school, but for the rest of their lives?</p>

        <h3 class="chapter-headline">Interpretation of vague discipline policies could lead to harsh punishment for students</h3>
        <h4 class="chapter-subhed">by Sara Chernikoff</h4>
        <p class="chaptertext">Disciplinary policy plays an extremely important role in a student’s public school experience. The wording of these policies can determine the harshness and extent of a punishment. Depending on the school district a student lives in, they may be subject to very different disciplinary action. Some students may be more vulnerable to discipline depending on how vague policies are interpreted by administrators.</p>
        <h5>Montgomery County</h5>
        <p class="chaptertext">Montgomery County Public Schools outlines <a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/policy/pdf/jgarb.pdf" target="_new">a guide for administrators</a> to follow when significant disciplinary action-suspensions, which involve students being excluded from their regular school program for no more than 10 days, and expulsions, which exclude students for 45 days or longer-must be taken against students. But though the guide is direct and detailed, application of these rules is often far from clear.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">The school system says that its disciplinary actions reflect a “restorative philosophy” that gives students opportunities to learn from and correct their mistakes, and to restore relationships that are disrupted by their conduct. But the county fails to define restorative disciplinary action in detail, describing it as “(focusing) on repairing harm to the community through dialogue that emphasizes individual accountability” and “(helping) build a sense of belonging, safety, and social responsibility in the school community.”</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">Furthermore, though long-term suspensions and expulsions are intended to be used only as “last resort options,” they are not prohibited for students as young as pre-kindergarten (though the policy discourages suspending or expelling students so young).</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">In order to determine what type of disciplinary action is taken against a student, their age, previous misconduct, cultural and linguistic factors, circumstances surrounding the incident and other aggravating circumstances are considered. Most of these factors are extremely vague in their language and definitions.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">The school is required to ensure “minimum education services” are provided to students during their suspension meaning, they are able to complete academic work they miss during the suspension period without penalty, but the policy is left open-ended for individual administrators to interpret, and there is no accountability outlined in the policy on how to measure the success of the “restorative discipline philosophy.”</p>
        <h5>Prince George's County</h5>
        <p class="chaptertext">Prince George's County lays out <a href="https://www.pgcps.org/student_rights_responsibilities.htm#SECTION%208:%20Disciplinary%20Response%20Terms" target="_new">a more detailed policy</a>, identifying specific situations that teachers and faculty may face when dealing with disciplinary actions. The disciplinary levels are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, broken down by grade level. For example, dishonesty, cheating and plagiarism are levels 1 or 2 for all grades, while use or attempted use of weapons is a 5 for students grade 3-5 and 6-12.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">Each example is broken down into a category and given to an official administrator to contact in case of misconduct. Although this chart is detailed, it may lead to more overall suspensions if administrators strictly follow through on the guidelines.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">According to data from the <a href="http://www.marylandpublicschools.org/about/Documents/DCAA/SSP/20172018Student/2018SuspensionsbySchoolIN.pdf" target="_new">Maryland State Department of Education</a>, Prince George's had a total of 1,646 suspensions in the 2017-18 school year, a majority of which were given to black male students. Over 60% of the suspensions were attributed to "disrespect/disruption," another vague categorization for a signficant punishment.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">Although the policy does not outline a “restorative discipline philosophy” like Montgomery County does, the Prince George's school system says that discipline should be "both corrective and instructive and designed to foster growth and understanding in the student," and that "appropriate responses to misbehavior are determined by the age and maturity of the student."</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">According to the policy, this type of approach may look like “restorative chats/questions, circles, academic circles, peer mediation, and community conferencing.” The lack of detail surrounding what makes discipline restorative may also lead to more re-offenses by already punished students.</p>
        <p class="chaptertext">The disciplinary policy laid out by Prince George’s County is more detailed and thorough than Montgomery County’s, but both ultimately fail to create accountability among administrators to promote restorative practices for disciplinary actions.</p>
